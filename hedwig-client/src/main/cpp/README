= BUILDING =

To build:
   $ libtoolize
   $ autoreconf -fi
   $ ./configure
   $ make

The devel packages for protobuf, log4cxx & boost are required to build.

= TESTING =

To test, Google Test(http://code.google.com/p/googletest/) is required.
The project must be configured with the location of gtest. Making with
the target "check" will run all the tests.

   $ ./configure --enable-gtest=/home/user/src/gtest-1.6.0
   $ make check

To run individual tests, first start a test cluster. We provide a 
convenience script to do this.

   $ sh scripts/tester.sh start-cluster

Once the cluster is running, you can run individual tests using the test
harness.

   $ test/hedwigtest --gtest_filter=PublishTest.testAsyncPublish

To get a list of tests:

   $ test/hedwigtest --gtest_list_tests

test/hedwigtest is a libtool wrapper, which cannot be used directly with
gdb. To run a test with gdb:

   $ libtool --mode=execute gdb test/hedwigtest
   (gdb) run --gtest_filter=PublishTest.testAsyncPublish
