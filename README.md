MessageQueue
============

This is  a message queue system to offer messaging service. 

This MQ system is transform from a opensource pub/sub system called Hedwig,
an important part of Apache BookKeeper project.

Since publish/subscribe sematics and message queue sematics are similar in some point,
we change Hedwig into a message queue system for efficiency.
